 * @brief Router class to manage routes and events

 * The router is the main class of the router module. It manages the routes and has the logic to route the events to the
 * correct policy. Also it has the thread pool to process the events, and the policy manager to manage the
 * runtime policies (creation, destruction, and interaction).
 * Get the events from the queue, select the correct policy (with the route priority and conditions), and send the
 * event to the policy.
